# Lean Theorems

A repository dedicated to my journey learning and implementing theorems in Lean 4. This space serves as both a study log and implementation archive for various mathematical and philosophical theorems.

    - `sri_yantra.lean` - Implementation of Sri Yantra geometric properties and theorems using Lean 4

## Current Projects

### Sri Yantra Implementation Details

The Sri Yantra implementation focuses on formalizing sacred geometry using rigorous mathematical proofs in Lean 4. 

#### Core Structures
- `SriYantraTriangle`: Represents the fundamental triangular structures with:
  - Equilateral triangle properties
  - Circumcenter calculations
  - Sacred proportion constraints
  - Angular relationships (2œÄ sum constraint)

- `ShaktiPath`: Models the energy pathways with:
  - Continuous path properties
  - Start and end point definitions
  - Flow direction constraints
  - Energy flow angle calculations (0 ‚â§ Œ∏ ‚â§ 2œÄ)

#### Key Theorems

1. **Geometric Properties**
- Golden Ratio relationships (œÜ = (1 + ‚àö5)/2)
- Sacred circle ratios (‚àö3 relationship between circumradius and inradius)
- Angular relationships (œÄ/6 relationships between triangles)

2. **Pathway Analysis**
- Intersection point properties (54 critical points)
- Bindu flow characteristics
- Mandala structure (9 centers and 9 radii)

3. **Unified Properties**
The implementation proves a comprehensive theorem (`sri_yantra_complete_properties`) that unifies:
- Golden ratio relationships
- Sacred circle proportions
- Angular symmetries
- Pathway intersections
- Bindu flow properties
- Mandala structural relationships
